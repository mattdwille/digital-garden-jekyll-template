# The Problem Of Reading
I listen to late Tolstoy, read the fat books of Ferrante, Knausgaard and Hervé Guibert’s diaries and fantasize they are simultaneously writing and living their lives. They are long-take writers. They circle back over the material again and again each time refracted through a slightly altered prism. There is comfort in their repetition. 

Often what is at stake, should she want to spell it out, is the idea that something is missing, as in: what is the crucial bit of urgently needed knowledge that will save her, at least for this day?

Where is the middle ground between absorption and anxiety, gratification and toil?

Woolf says of reading: The only advice...is to take no advice...follow your instincts...use your reason.
